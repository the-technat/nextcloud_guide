# nextcloud_guide

Setup a Nextcloud Instance with security by design in an automated, desired state fashion.

## Overview

To build the nextcloud instance two technologies are used in combination:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

To automatically run the tools Gitlab's [CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) software is used. Thus resulting in that "pipeline" that runs on every change and triggers Terraform and Ansible.

### Terraform

Terraform is an IaC tool that builds your infrastructure in the cloud based on definition written in code.

### Ansible

Ansible is a configuration management tool that works agentless using ssh and a lot of python code.

## Technical Insights

### SSH Access

Ansible needs SSH access yo your server, preferably using key-based authentication. If you create a Cloud server on Hetzner Cloud you don't have to install the OS, you can just use one of their prebuild VM templates. This allows you to specify an SSH Key for the Root user which in turn means you will get no E-Mail from Hetzner with the root password for your newly created server. This way ansible can login to your server only with the ssh-key you specified when creating your server and start configuring your server. While this is the most simple way to provide access to Ansible there is one problem with it: What if you want to change the SSH config (specifically the SSH Port) using ansible? Then Ansible will fail in a second run, because your SSH port is now different.

There are two solutions to this problem:

- Use Cloud-Init to configure SSH for you before ansible even starts to run.
- Make an Ansible Role that will handle the Port change for you and is aware of that problem. See [this awesome blogpost](https://dmsimard.com/2016/03/15/changing-the-ssh-port-with-ansible/) for an example on how to do this.

If you want Ansible to use an other user than `root` to confiure your server you wil get the same problem again. Once you setup a User using ansible, how do you tell ansible to switch to the newly created user? Although you could write a similar role like the one in the blogpost above, I prefer to do this using cloud-init. There you can configure SSH and a user for ansible on the first boot and never have to deal with that in ansible. But! This is a philosophical question and depending on who you ask you may get a different answer. I explained that problem here so that people are aware of it and can decide for them what may be best for their use-case.


## Ansilbe invocation

If Terraform has provisioned your server, how do you invoke ansible? There are several ways how you can connect them, the simplest of them would be to have some sort of CI/CD pipeline that gathers the outputs of terraform and configures ansible with them. In this repo we are using [Terraform Provisioners](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/provisioners) to run the playbook against the server.

## Usage

### Preparations

Create a new Repository for your NC instance.

The following CI/CD variables must exist:

- `ansible_private_key`: File containing the private key for ansible
- `ansible_public_key`: File containing the public key for ansible
- `hcloud_dns_token`: Masked variable containing a DNS API token for hetzner dns
- `hcloud_token`: Masked variable containing an API token for Hetzner Cloud

Then copy the files from this repository over to your new repository and edit the `settings.tfvars` as well as the `variables.yml` file to your likings.

Once you commit your changes the pipeline should automatically trigger and build your NC instance.
